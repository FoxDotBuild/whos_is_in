# Sally Gradle

Sally Gradle is a maker of websites on the WordPress platform. Before becoming a full-time freelancer, she worked as an office manager in small manufacturing concerns, often wearing many hats as is common in small businesses.

When she's not building websites or following the advances in the field, Sally can be found in a number of low-tech activities. She is an avid vegetable gardener and early adopter of the Farmbot. The 2017 growing season will be the first with this technology, so there will, of course, be a blog. Other interests include knitting and sewing. She also likes to cook, a lot, and eat it.
